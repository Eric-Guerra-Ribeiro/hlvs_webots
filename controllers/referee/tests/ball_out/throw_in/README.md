# Ball-out - throw-in

## What is tested

The ball is going to leave the field from the touchline after being touched by a player. The autoRef should respawn the ball at where it left the field.

## Setup

- Team RED has Kick-off and is on left side
- One robot from each team are used

## Description

1. RED 1 touches the ball after PLAYING, then the ball is about to move outside the field from the touchline, but it does not entirely cross the line. Thus, the game is still in play.
2. Again, it is about to move outside the field from the touchline, and it entirely crosses the line. Thus, the ball is respawned at where it left the field.
